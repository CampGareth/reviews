# Electriq MIMO (iqlean-lr02c30)

I recently bought a robot vacuum and it seems there are very few reviews out for this model so I thought I'd write one.

## Background

I've previously owned a robot vacuum, it was a Xiaomi Mi Robot Vacuum first generation. At the time I owned it I lived in a flat with short pile carpet so there was a single level to work with and the robot could roam around the entire space. I didn't have any pets and was careful about cable management so the robot could run every day unattended while I was out. Life was good. There were exceptions though. Having to empty the vacuum's bin every day was a pain in hindsight, it was fairly small with nooks and crannies to be cleaned. The vacuum had a HEPA filter that needed washing on the regular. I ocassionally was careless with cables but virtual walls weren't supported on this model so I sometimes came back to a stuck robot and a shredded cable. Still this was all worth it for not having to vacuum manually. Eventually I moved to a home with 3 floors, then I got some kittens and one of them urinated on the xiaomi, that killed it. There were no sparks, only some discolouration and corrosion on a cliff sensor. Turns out all your cliff sensors must be functional for the robot to move and they're not easy parts to replace because they're not wear items.

## Goals, hopes, dreams

It's been a couple of years and my cats are older so I can trust them not to destroy electronics (usually) now. I also had a brush with fleas and one way to control them is to vacuum regularly so I thought this is the opportunity I'd been waiting for to get another vacuum. If I can fix all the pain points from the previous model with virtual walls, self-emptying etc. that would be good. If it could do some mopping that would be even better. I kept an eye out then spotted a deal on HotUKDeals...

## Review
### Price and buying experience
Let's start with the price, £280 for robot, self-emptying base station and some monster themed stickers. Not bad really. I could have bought a xiaomi equivalent for £500 or a roborock model for something crazy (at CES 2022 they showed off a 1300 EUR model with self-emptying, self-mop-refilling, self-mop-cleaning, AI obstacle avoidance... I'll wait for the price to drop). The buying experience through AppliancesDirect (whose parent company owns the Electriq brand) was smooth until shipping, they claimed it was in stock and registered the package with DPD then just... waited for 2 weeks before sending it. Sure I went for cheap shipping but once the package was registered DPD assumed it'd be delivered next day so sent emails and got me all excited. Ah well.

### Vacuum
The unit itself seems sturdy enough for its job, though I wouldn't stand on it. Two buttons and a LIDAR sensor on top. Bumper on the front. Removable dust bin at the back. Two side brushes, cliff sensors, a main brush and oddly 4 charging contacts on the bottom, two at the back on the bin and two at the front. The xiaomi had charging contacts on the back. The bin itself is shallow but large and hinges at one of the long sides making it easy to open. Very well thought out, no nooks or crannies so it can be tipped out easily. There's a HEPA filter in the top and a thin screen in front of it, it means most fluff can be brushed off the screen and the HEPA filter lasts longer between cleans. There's a hole for dust to be swept into the bin then a hole at the opposite side covered with a spring loaded flap. This is for the self-emptying function. 3 pins on the robot mate with 2 contacts on the bin, on the dust bin these are routed to charger contacts on the bottom and on the mop bin they go to a small motor I don't know the purpose of yet, maybe it controls flow rate but its effectiveness is questionable.

### Base station
The base station is a rounded box with a nook under it for the vacuum. It has two charging points and a hole in the base. The top is a hinged lid that opens up. The back has a hole in it, you can't push this flush against a wall but it can be fairly close. There's a bright white LED on the front that flashes slowly constantly, 3 layers of duct tape tones that down. Inside the top lid is a 3L vacuum bag with a stiff bit of cardboard for alignment. This is honestly the first time I've used a bagged vacuum before but it makes sense here. Power rating is 1050W. When the robot has cleaned it returns to the dock backwards so its bin is facing the dock. It signals through
